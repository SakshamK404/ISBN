#Hello.py :
This Python script utilizes the PyQt5 library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying book details. Let's break down its functionality:

1. GUI Setup: The `setupUi` method is responsible for defining the layout and appearance of the main window (`MainWindow`). It sets the window's size and initializes various widgets to display book information.

2. Widget Placement: The script utilizes labels (`QLabel`) to display different attributes of the book, such as its name, author, publisher, language, and description. Scroll areas (`QScrollArea`) are provided for attributes that may require scrolling due to longer content.

3. Dynamic Content: While the initial setup defines the layout and appearance of the GUI, the actual content displayed in the labels (`label_7`, `label_9`, etc.) is set dynamically based on the book data. This dynamic approach allows for flexibility in displaying different books with varying attributes.

4. Translation Support: The `retranslateUi` method handles the translation of text displayed on widgets. It sets the text for labels such as "NAME:", "AUTHOR:", etc., ensuring that the GUI can be easily localized for different languages.

5. Execution Flow: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the script is executed only when run directly, not when imported as a module. Within this block:
   - The PyQt5 application (`QApplication`) is initialized.
   - An instance of the `Ui_ISBN` class is created to set up the GUI.
   - The main window is displayed (`MainWindow.show()`).
   - The application enters its event loop (`app.exec_()`), waiting for events such as user input or interaction.

In summary, this script serves as a foundation for building a GUI application to display book details. It offers flexibility to adapt to various book attributes and supports multiple languages through dynamic content generation and translation support. By utilizing PyQt5, it enables the creation of interactive and visually appealing interfaces for managing and viewing book information.
#house.py
This Python script demonstrates the implementation and comparison of two popular sorting algorithms: Quick Sort and Merge Sort. Let's break down its functionality:

1. Import Libraries: The script begins by importing the `random` and `time` libraries. `random` is used to generate a random array of integers for sorting, while `time` is used to measure the execution time of each sorting algorithm.

2. Partition Function (Quick Sort): The `partition` function implements the partitioning step of the Quick Sort algorithm. It selects a pivot element (usually the last element), rearranges the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and elements larger than the pivot are placed after it. It returns the index of the pivot element after partitioning.

3. Quick Sort Function: The `quick_sort` function recursively sorts the array using the Quick Sort algorithm. It partitions the array around a pivot element and then recursively sorts the subarrays on the left and right sides of the pivot.

4.  Merge Sort Function:  The `merge_sort` function implements the Merge Sort algorithm, which recursively divides the array into halves until each subarray contains only one element. Then, it merges the subarrays in a sorted order.

5.  Merge Function : The `merge` function is a helper function used by the Merge Sort algorithm to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

6.  Main Function : The `main` function serves as the entry point of the script. It generates a random array of integers and prints the unsorted array. Then, it sorts the array using both Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms, measuring the execution time of each sorting operation.

7. Output : The script prints the unsorted array, the sorted arrays obtained from Quick Sort and Merge Sort, and the execution time taken by each sorting algorithm.

8.  Execution : Finally, the `main` function is called to execute the sorting operations and display the results.

In summary, this script provides a practical demonstration of Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms applied to sorting an array of integers. It not only showcases the implementation of these algorithms but also compares their performance in terms of execution time, offering insights into their efficiency for sorting large datasets.
